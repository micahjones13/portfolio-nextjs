      "I've been an avid gamer since I was a kid. The first game I fell in love with was The Legend of Zelda, Ocarina of Time. What a masterpiece. I've played most every Zelda sicne then. From there I played Halo: Combat Evolved on my Dad's old Mac and was introuduced to how fun FPS's can be. The entire Halo series has been very defining for me. More recently I've been playing a ton of Destiny 2 (around 3000 hours, let's say that's a testiment to my commitment). However, Baulders Gate 3 has been topped my favorite game of all time.",

      "Along with gaming, sports were a huge part of my childhood. I played club soccer and started playing football in 4th grade. Football soon became my favorite, and I played up until my senior year in high school. I played quarterback until someone who could throw the ball much better than me came along, which is when I switched to slot reciever. I wasn't anything special but some of my fondest memories are from playing football.",

      "Because I got into gaming so early in my life, I've also been obsessed with technology. A few years ago I finally bought my first gaming level PC, in which I immediatley tried to play Skyrim with 3k+ mods (unsuccessfully, of course). Computer tech continues to be something I spend time on, always hoping to get an upgrade for my PC.",
